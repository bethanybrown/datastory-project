      <h2>What does Google do with the data that it collects?</h2>
      <p style="text-align: center;color:white;font-size:18px;">
        There are over 40,000 Google searches processed every second, making
        over 3.5 billion searches per day and 1.2 trillion searches per year
        worldwide. Surprisingly, Google collects all of the data that it can
        from keeping what you search on record to taking note of where you are.
        The data that Google collects contributes to advancing all aspects of
        Google's outreach. Even when you use Google Maps, your destination and
        tracked journey lead to creating a more user friendly experience for
        everyone. Your travels help to confirm and declare the timing of trips
        and traffic, and this is only possibly through data collection of every
        user. However, the deeper you dig into how much Google knows about you
        based on daily activities, the more people are concerned with their
        privacy. As long as you have a Google account, which most people do,
        they have access to your name, birthday, email, social accounts,
        calendar, and other personal information. In order to ensure consumers'
        privacy, Google breaks down their policies on their privacy pages. More
        information can be found in the Resources.

          <h2>About</h2>
          <p style="text-align:center;color:white;font-size:18px;">My interest
            in Google was inspired by a project in which we collected data for a
            week about something relevant to our lives. I am an avid user of
            Googles services, therefore, I recorded everything that I Googled in
            a day. By the end of the week, my data showed that I most commonly
            used Google to ask questions while at home. </p>
